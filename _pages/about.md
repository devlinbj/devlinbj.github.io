The Devlin lab has two major foci, the development or refinement of statistical methods for the analysis of genetic data and the implementation of such methods to discover the genetic basis of disease and related phenotypes. On the statistical front, our major efforts involve methods appropriate for large-scale genetic studies, including association, copy number variants and sequencing. Much of our empirical work targets such studies, with an emphasis on characterizing the genetic basis of autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia.

We have close ties with Kathryn Roeder's group in the Department of Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University. Devlin and Roeder have a collaborative relationship that has continued since 1987, when we coauthored our first statistical genetics manuscript, which was published in Theoretical and Applied Genetics the next year. We hold joint lab meetings covering both advanced statistical methods and genetics.
