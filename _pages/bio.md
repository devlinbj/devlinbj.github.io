# Bio

I graduated from The Pennsylvania State University in 1986, after which I had a post-doc appintment at the University of California, Riverside. Since then I worked as a biostatistician and research faculty in the Division of Biostatistics, Yale University School of Medicine (1990-1994), had a visiting appointment in Carnegie Mellon University, Department of Statistics (1995-1996), and have since been a faculty member of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine (Psychiatry). I have been working in the field of human genetics for the past 32 years and in psychiatric genetics for the past 25 years.


# Specific Research Interests

My research has three major foci: the development or refinement of statistical methods for the analysis of genetic data; the implementation of such methods to discover the genetic basis of disease and related phenotypes; and placing these findings in neurobiology. My work has been recognized by admission as a fellow to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Statistics Section.
